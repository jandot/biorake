h1. Why this project?

There is some interest in the bioinformatics community for using rake
as a workflow tool (see e.g. this "blog post from BioinformaticsZen":http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/2008/05/organised-bioinformatics-exp
).

Rake could be ideal for this type of work: a typical workflow will
take data and perform a first set of conversions on it (i.e. a task),
followed by a second set of conversions (that is dependent on the
first task), and so on. And obviously, bioinformaticians want to keep their data
in databases rather than files...

A typical Rakefile could look like this:
<pre>
 task :001_load_data do
   <load data in database>
 end

 task :002_calculate_averages => [:001_load_data] do
   <update data in database>
 end

 task :003_make_histogram_of_averages => [:002_calculate_averages] do
   <do stuff>
 end
</pre>

The trouble is that there is no way yet to check whether a task has to be rerun
or not, because there are no timestamps. Regular rake will rerun all three
tasks from the example above, regardless if some of them have already been done.

BioRake adds this task timestamp functionality to rake for working with 
databases. The functionality needed is very similar to the one available for
FileTasks.

So if we had reloaded the data (001), the timestamp for that task
in a meta table would be later than the one for task 002. As a
result, task 002 would automatically have to be rerun if we were to
run task 003. 

h1. Implementation

I've started to implement an additional type of task, called *db*. The above
snippet from a Rakefile would actually contain
<pre>
 db :001_load_data do
   ...
 end
 
 db :002_calculated_averages => [:001_load_data] do
   ...
 end
</pre>
instead of using the *task* tag.

Similar to a FileTask, *timestamps* are used to check if certain tasks have to 
be re-run or not. FileTasks have the advantage that every file has a timestamp. 
To implement this in a database, I decided to create a *meta table* that keeps 
track of a task name and the moment it was run. Here's an example of what such 
a table would look like.

<pre>
  id  task                            updated_at
 ==========================================================
   1  001_load_data                   2008-06-11 14:05:44
   2  002_calculate_averages          2008-06-11 14:05:45
   3  003_make_histogram_of_averages  2008-06-11 14:06:03
</pre>



A *db task* automatically:

# checks the meta table to see if the task has already been run
# if so: are there any prerequisites with timestamps that are newer than the task
itself?
# (re)run the task if necessary
# update the meta table

h1. Sample

The sample/ directory contains an example of how this can be used. Suppose a
researcher has intensities for a group of individuals on a number of probes. 
This information should be loaded into a database with the tables _individuals_,
_probes_ and _intensities_.

As the _intensities_ table contains foreign keys for individual and probe, the
_individuals_ and _probes_ tables have to be loaded *before* the intensities can
be loaded.

In rake-speak, this would look like:
<pre>
db :load_probes do
  _load the actual data_
end

db :load_individuals do
  _load the actual data_
end

db :load_intensities => [:load_probes, :load_individuals] do
  _load the actual data_
end
</pre>

In a later step, the researcher might want to calculate the average intensity 
per probe. This would be a new task that depends on the intensities being 
loaded:
<pre>
db :calculate_averages => [:load_intensities] do
  _calculate averages and store in probes table_
end
</pre>

Here, we call the database that will contain the data _example.sqlite3_. The 
_meta_ table is contained in a separated database called _biorake.sqlite3_.
